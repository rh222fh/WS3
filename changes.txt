  refactored by moving the DealCard method from Player to Dealer class and modified the DealCard method to make it work for every rule class.

- Added a parameter(boolean) in the DealCard method to show a card after dealing a card, 
  and refactored by updating the classes AmericanNewGameStrategy and InternationalNewGameStrategy, and by removing duplicate code.
